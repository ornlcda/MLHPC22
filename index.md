# Workshop Overview

The workshop will be held in conjunction with SC22: The International Conference for High Performance Computing, 
Networking, Storage and Analysis located in Dallas, TX on November 13 - 20. The intent of this workshop is to b
ring together researchers, practitioners, and scientific communities to discuss methods that utilize extreme 
scale systems for machine learning. This workshop will focus on the greatest challenges in utilizing HPC for 
machine learning and methods for exploiting data parallelism, model parallelism, ensembles, and parameter search. 
We invite researchers and practitioners to participate in this workshop to discuss the challenges in using HPC for 
machine learning and to share the wide range of applications that would benefit from HPC powered machine learning.
