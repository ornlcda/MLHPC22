# Overview

The workshop will be held in conjunction with SC22: The International Conference for High Performance Computing, 
Networking, Storage and Analysis located in Dallas, TX on November 13 - 18, 2022. The intent of this workshop is to 
bring together researchers, practitioners, and scientific communities to discuss methods that utilize extreme 
scale systems for machine learning. This workshop will focus on the greatest challenges in utilizing HPC for 
machine learning and methods for exploiting data parallelism, model parallelism, ensembles, and parameter search. 
We invite researchers and practitioners to participate in this workshop to discuss the challenges in using HPC for 
machine learning and to share the wide range of applications that would benefit from HPC powered machine learning.

## Scope

The major topics of interest to the workshop include but are not limited to:

* Machine learning models, including deep learning, for extreme scale systems
* Enhancing applicability of machine learning in HPC (e.g. feature engineering, usability, explainability, robustness)
* Learning large models/optimizing hyper parameters (e.g. deep learning, representation learning, graph neural network)
* Facilitating very large ensembles in extreme scale systems
* Training machine learning models on large datasets and scientific data
* Overcoming the problems inherent to large datasets (e.g. noisy labels, missing data, scalable ingest)
* Applications of machine learning utilizing HPC
* Future research challenges for machine learning at large scale
* Large scale machine learning applications
